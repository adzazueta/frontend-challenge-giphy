Welcome to the challenge for the Frontend Developer position! This README contains the challenge details and instructions for completing it.

## Project Description

The objective of this test is to evaluate your Frontend development skills, your ability to work with APIs, and your proficiency in handling data and promises. You are required to create a web application that meets the following requirements:

1. **Search Input**: There should be an input field on the page where the user can enter any word or phrase.

2. **Connect to the Giphy API**: When the user enters a word or phrase and clicks a search button, the application should connect to the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search) and display GIFs related to the search on the page. **[You will need an API Key](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard)**

3. **GIF Quantity Filter**: The application should allow the user to select a specific quantity of GIFs to display. You can implement this through a slider, a numeric field, or any other user interface of your choice.

You can use any technology or framework of your choice to complete this test. What we will primarily evaluate is the thinking and creativity in the implementation of the solution.

Happy Coding!!!
